            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie-webpageProject</h1>
            <p>I learned that with peer working on this project it is much better for us to learn on our teamwork working together and with our brainstorming as we did all the CSS together. I learned lots of things along hte way
            wiht one of them being trying out new things like other border styles besides my original solid but other styles, I got out of my comfort zone quite a lot as i used many different styles to help look my work a little more appealing
            with it becoming quite interesting as most of the things that i done on the project was most of the things that i find hard in in which i got more cmofortable in to doing that with importing images that i feel more
            comfortable in too</p>
            
            <p>To breifly summerize my project it is mostly about creating a Web desgin page for others to see as what my movie is gonna be about but more about on how i created in a website kind of way
            with it being about romance nothing much but abot 3 people in a love triangle by the title 2 triangels and one circle with it being 2 being the triangles of the boys and one circle being the girl that is caught up with all of this dram
            and that on how one is her childhood friend and treats her very well but also has hidden feelings for her, but the other who she just recently meet was someone whos really nice as it was love at first sight for the boy as he chases her and persues her in order for her one day to 
            say yes to him, Its basically about either which one that she falls in love with. I used all sort of coding for it as i used.. </p>
            
            <p>Of course manly are the CSS i planned about my work in my plan.md which is like amardown page for me to edit everything and help me plan out my story and then i pasted my story onto HTML and then started on with my CSS with me
            decorating each one of it with my partner doing most of the CSS while me i didn most of the planning as we both did our parts equally.</p>

            <h1>Challenges?</h1>

            <p>For me sometimes that has been trobling my on how my codes and work would actually look like once i created it since at that time i didn't know what color scheme that I should do or what kind of font that i should make it into
             its kind of hard ot decide but then with my partner we both figured out on which color we should use that is for the best of our projects that we think would really work on the story that we had
            the colors were light as we don't plan this ot be a heavy kind of story more like a soothing movie to watch during the cold seasons. </p>

            <h1>Takeaways?</h1>
           
            <p>from all of that i experienced i learned of a important lesson as that is to sometimes you don't know what to decide you can alawsy ask for help aorund you as you don't need to be afriad as they migth be doing the same thing as you that you never noticed its like these
            kind of projects that can help you carry out your true style of yourself that you can do within your own limitations wiht you doing freestyled and you can make wonderful project like these.</p>
            <p>For my next steps i would like ot do these 3 things</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Experiment and play aorund with CSS a bit more asim still not used ot it yet.</li>
                  <li>Being able to learn about visuals of color and creativity projects like these.</li>
                  <li>Being able to one day doing it well with more people.</li>
            </ul>
