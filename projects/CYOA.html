            <h1>Learned</h1>
            <p>From this project I have learned some things actually, its mostly about planning according and we did as such,we stayed in contact about what we each should do,
            Me and my partner decided upon that we should do our part seperately so that our code's don't get mixed up and that way we can work on our work more easier, once we finish
            we put them all together. The next day when we discussed about the changes and errors that were the problems we saw what was missing and what was wrong so we planned on fixing
            that, as frmo time to time we git pulled just to stay up to each other's work progress, we communicate a little thorughout but I think we both getted on what were supposed to do
            and we understood eachother's signals. For me probably was about good planning that led us success to this project.</p>

            <h2>About?</h2>
              <p>We did a scenerio of "homework having due at 12:00", because i thought myself that would be interesting based off my personal experiences, i would guess my partner choosing that because of that 
            it is a interesting topic to work on, There is lots of planning to turn out how this would look like and how it would turn out, and in the end i kinda liked of what I created throughout.<p>
                
            <p> For this project I did with my partner is that we did a "Choose your own Adventure project", and that we created a adventure based ont he topic that were decided that we both liked doing and 
                that we then begin to plan it out useing google drawings planning out all the senerios that we are going to do and what leads to that and what leads to that kind of ending. We liked the idea
            of 3 main parts of a scenerio and form there we expanded it to more choices leading ot new events os there and there. And when it does it end we take it to the start all over again for them to 
            do the events that hopefully leads to something new. For this project mostly we used markdowns, and we didn't do a lot of code. but mostly we used a source of great planning and collaborating work
                that we use, in the end we fininshed faster then we expected. </p>

            <h1>Challenges?</h1>
            <p>There wasn't a lot of challenges along the way but some due ot being that we had some merdge conflicts there and there as we then fixed it, but thats mostly part of the challenge that we had, but something else is that
            in truth me and my partner don't know each other and it made hard for us to have a proper conversation and it made it hard for us to do things together but I made through these challenges by
            trying to be the multivated person between my partner and he listened pretty well and i would say helping both of us plan things made things easier since my partner is a person who follows plans quite smoothly
            nothing to difficult.</p>
            <h6>In summary of challenge</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>Merge conflicts</li>
                 <li>social communication</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h1>Takeaways</h1>
<p>from this project i have learned that sometimes working with new people can be awkward and can be not that easy but you can alwasy coriprirate with them in different ways through many different communication ways, as such
i have mentioned before which is thruogh planning and even with a little bit of communication. You don't have to be afraid of workingn with people you don't know, you don't entirely have to be freinds with them for them to be comfortable around you
can most definitely work and complete tasks without much comunication in my defense.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps?</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>To be able to learn more complex markdowns</li>
                 <li>To be able to adchieve more of what we could do</li>
                 <li>To be also improve my social skills</li>
                </ul>
