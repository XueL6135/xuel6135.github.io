            <p>This project is one of the projects that took me a year long to do and its one of hte projcts that I found proud in to do, it helped me boost a lot of my skills, such as th eon ni am most proud of is my confidence.</p>
            <p>Learned?</p>
            <p>I learned that durnig this part of work, asking others for help isn't a bad thing but more of a good th8ing considering there might be some things that i don't know but others do and that helped me a lot knowing that I have people around me to help me whenever they can. I learned that I can't waste my time, And That I need to be able to hand in my work on time otherwise i can't keep up with the assignments. The last thing i learned was that meeting new people nwhen introducing my projects is a great way to start building bonds between your classmates considering I will be stuck with them during the rest of my high school years.  </p>

            <p>About?</p>
            <p>For my Project I did my topic on foresnic science because as a person of a scienc Geek i personally love science and Foresnic is something that involves with cool experiments like finding out crimes and other things you can do in labs which for me sounds very interesting so i took up the chance and do it. My project is abogut showing you the inetresting things about foresnic science while also you my products that involve with my thinking along wiht my softwares and hardwares that i have collected. And the tool i used which is A frame whic i find the most fun in. </p>

            <p>Challenges?</p>
            <p>There were a lot of challenges throughout my process and that starts with being that being creating my A frame and it would come out like and that came out didn't like how i expected it to be considering that I didn't didn't how to position my shapes and how I can arrange them. The navbar was a bit tricky as well as i couldn't get it to stick on top, i  tried so many different ways but it turns out that it was just my template not letting me to do it,In the end there were also time management issues where the times of test adn the projects that was due was coming up so that i didn't have a lot of time doing my project. </p>


            <p>Takeaways?</p>

            <p>My takeaways is that don't wait till the last minute to do this and manage your time well when it comes to these many projects, plan ahead of times on when on the days that you need to do something so that you can make time for more of the important things. Ask your friends if you need any help if your friends don't know then go ask for your teachers, in all from this project, time is of the essence.</p>

            <p>For my next steps, I would like to do these 3 things:</p>
            <ul>
<li>Make and use more of my skils in computer science adn give my best efforts.</li>
<li>learning new things/codes</li>
<li>Making new bonds along the way.</li>
                </ul>
