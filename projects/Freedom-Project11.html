             <p style="color:white;">Context</p>
                <p style="color:white;">I am a student at Hstat in the Software Engineering Program. The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

                For my project, I chose to independently study p5play in order to help me make cat gambler, as to bring awareness in real life of this system.</p>

             <p style="color:white;">Learned?</p>
          <p style="color:white;"> i learned that during the project there was a lot of implications and bugs that was going to happen and no matter how hard we try it would take us hours just to record one thing because it will crash out with all the others.
            In the middle of the processing we wanted to take a break and then continue on because During this year there was a lot of things that we must do and we were a lot busier than when we were last year There was Definitely a lot of schedule changes Between us Partners So we had to improvise that a little bitWe learned that it was okay to take breaks in the middle of things and then take a rest The work Because You need proper rest Since there was a lot of things that we must doWe figure that we can't just cram it all one day And do it all at one day.</p>

              <p style="color:white;"></p>About?</p>
            <p style="color:white;"> our game is more featured on the system of gambling but not as that gambling but more of so in the game of some entertaining Gambling you want it to sew that we can bring awareness to other people about the diction of gambling and how it works in real life also works almost the same as in Game,We want to really bring that outBecause we figure that a lot of people in this generation are more into this system of gambling, I only think that it's a problem that definitely should be adjusted and discussed.
            So we made the game in order to set a little example for other people and how gambling it's like and how addicting it can be And how Simply it works In The View of this generation.

              <p style="color:white;">Challenges?</p>
              <p style="color:white;">There were a lot of challenges throughout my process and that starts with being that being creating my A frame and it
                would come out like and that came out didn't like how i expected it to be considering that I didn't didn't how to position
                my shapes and how I can arrange them. The navbar was a bit tricky as well as i couldn't get it to stick on top, i  tried
                so many different ways but it turns out that it was just my template not letting me to do it,In the end there were also
                time management issues where the times of test adn the projects that was due was coming up so that i didn't have a lot
                of time doing my project. </p>


              <p style="color:white;">Takeaways?</p>

              <p style="color:white;"> time was really not well on managed and it was more Scheduling So that we can do the project where we are going to meet And Where are we going to do this We come across a lot of problems with this because It was More difficult this year.
              I would like to say that sometimes its ok to procracinate a little from time to time because theres a lot of things this year that needs attention rather than SEP so In the end you don't need to work as hard.</p>

              <p style="color:white;">For my next steps, I would like to do these 3 things:</p>
            <ul>
<li style="color:white;">Never give up on what you think you might not or can't do</li>
<li style="color:white;">Be more self aware of myself in certain parts</li>
<li style="color:white;">communicating with people/partners</li>
                </ul>
